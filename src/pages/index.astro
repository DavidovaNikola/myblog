    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Nikola. Originally from the Czech Republic, I spent my formative years there and completed my studies. Later, I lived in California for five years before relocating to Greece. Currently, 
        I am pursuing a degree in Software Development at the university while working as an agent with a focus on customer service. Although my work may diverge from this topic, I am committed to giving my best.

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
        One of my primary interests lies in my work and job responsibilities, particularly related to Microsoft products. Additionally, I enjoy playing League of Legends, although I’m currently in the bronze rank and haven’t been able to advance. 
        However, as the saying goes, ‘Never give up!’ I continue to strive for improvement.
